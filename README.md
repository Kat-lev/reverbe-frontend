# Reverberacions d’Amor i Odi (RAIO) – Diari Reverbe interface

**Reverberacions d’Amor i Odi (RAIO)** is an experimental exploration of digital interfaces, where existing technologies are reclaimed to reflect on social networks, contemporary connections, and the echoes of our digital selves. Through this project, humble community archives are created—repositories of reflections that reverberate across screens, actions, and collective imagination.  

Discover the wider research project here: [RAIO Official Site](https://raio.issim.net/)

This repository hosts the interface where reflections take form and circulate: [Diari Reverbe](https://diari-reverbe.github.io/reverbe/)

The backend was created in Python by Azahara Cerezo.
